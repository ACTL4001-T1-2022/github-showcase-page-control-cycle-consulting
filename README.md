This GitHub repository documents the code and methodology use in completing the Society of Actuaries Research Institute 2022 Case Challenge. 

The aim of the challenge is to construct a national footbal team for the fictional country of Rarita, with the goal of achieving a positive economic impact for the country.

PROJECT SUMMARY 
Football is a sport loved and played by billions worldwide. Beyond this, football can provide countries with opportunities for economic gain, global visibility and improved social outcomes. 

In recognizing this, the country of Rarita has engaged our team to develop a strategy for entering the international Football and Sporting Association (“FSA”) League and develop a Rarita Football brand. 

This GitHub repository documents the code and methodology use in completing the Society of Actuaries Research Institute 2022 Case Challenge. For an in-depth exploration of our methodology, assumptions and strategy, please refer to our project report. [insert link to the report]

The project began with the process of team selection which involves identifying key selection criteria and then applying it through a predictive model to select the most competitive team. Through the selection of a high performing team, Rarita has strong chances of placing within the top 10 and achieving the FSA championship within 10 years. 
[insert Figure 2: Projected Team Ranking – 95% Confidence Interval]

With such achievements, the resulting commercial success creates a cycle of strategic growth by generating sufficient resources to allow implementation of key strategies which support the development of players to their maximum potential whilst engaging the broader community. 
[insert Figure 5: Cycle of Strategic Growth]

Through our two expenditure programs, investments are aimed at the grassroots level, allowing an equitable re-distribution of profits to improve the general quality of life and wellbeing. Ultimately, our strategies will guarantee sustainable and profitable growth, creating on average over ∂11,640 mil worth of annual socio-economic benefits. 
[insert Figure 8: Average Annual Socio-Economic Impact]

Ultimately, through our team selection and implementation strategies, we expect Rarita to achieve the below three objectives and successfully develop a Rarita Football brand over the next ten years.
